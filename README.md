# PyBer_Analysis
### by Terra Lasho

## Overview 
I was tasked to analyze ride share data (Pyber) in order to provide and summarize the distribution of fares by the types of cities in which Pyber operates so that they can better facilitate access to their services for specific city-types. For this, I will generate a multiple-line visual that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

Several key findings include: 
- Urban cities: 
    -highest demand for rides (based on rides), and more drivers than suburban (more than four times) and rural (more than 30 times)
- Suburban cities:
    -more drivers than rural (more than 6 times), with >4x the revenue. 
- Rural cities:
    -highest fare average per ride and driver

- The summary data shows a direct relationship of fare revenue by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides. 

## Summary

Based on the analysis my business recommendations are: 

The average fare per ride and driver is much higher in Rural than in both Suburban and Urban areas.  This data suggests that there may be less drivers available and/or longer rides in rural areas, which could cost revenue. Recommendations are to track time per ride for future, in order to see if more drivers are needed in rural areas -especially duing peak times during the day. Overall, this data indicates the need to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand.
