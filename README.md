# PyBer_Analysis
### by Terra Lasho

## Overview 
I was tasked to analyze ride share data (Pyber) in order to provide and summarize the distribution of fares by the types of cities in which Pyber operates so that they can better facilitate access to their services for specific city-types. For this, I will generate a multiple-line visual that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

Several key findings include: 
- Urban cities: 
    -highest demand for rides
    -more drivers than suburban (more than four times)
- Suburban cities:
    -more drivers than rural (more than 6 times), with >4x the revenue. 
- Rural cities:
    -highest fare average per ride and driver 

- The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides. 

## Summary

Based on the analysis my business recommendations are: 
Increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. 
Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
